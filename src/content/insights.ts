This mindset is deeply rooted in the core principles of Confucianism, which prioritizes social harmony and stability over disruptive, short-term gains. To understand China's impact is not necessarily to \"take a side,\" but to recognize that a patient, multi-decadal commitment is required to transition toward a kinder, cleaner, and healthier world." },

      { type: "p", text: "In essence, China is not waiting for plant-based trends to dictate the future of food; it is using a state-led industrial strategy to mandate a bioeconomy revolution. By applying the same logic that allowed them to dominate the EV and renewable energy sectors, China is poised to lead the world in alternative proteins. This patient capital approach, rooted in Confucian values of harmony and long-term stability, offers a stark alternative to the often-exhausted cycles of Western political shifts." },

Against that backdrop, Beyond Impact and UMITO Partners have begun co-developing the ocean-focused impact fund Blue Frontier Fund (BFF). In Part 1, Partner Sagar Tandon (Beyond Impact) and Founder Shunji Murakami (UMITO Partners) discuss the origins of the fund and the future they are working to build." },

      { type: "h2", text: "Where does our capital flow? — The origins of Beyond Impact" },
      { type: "p", text: "Sagar traces Beyond Impact back to Claire Smith's conviction, taking shape around 2016, that the health of the planet, of people, and of all living beings is fundamentally interconnected. The starting question was simple: where is my capital actually going? Passive vehicles like the S&P 500 are rational wealth-compounding tools, but many of the underlying companies are not actively driving positive change for society or the environment." },
      { type: "p", text: "From that question, Claire launched the ETF Beyond Investing, which has grown to roughly USD 133 million in AUM. But the team realised an ETF could shift capital flows without fundamentally transforming companies or markets — so the next step was direct investment in innovators, particularly startups working on the SDG 12 agenda of responsible consumption and production." },

      { type: "h2", text: "Kinder, cleaner, healthier" },
      { type: "p", text: "Sagar describes the three pillars at the centre of Beyond Impact's investment philosophy. 'Kinder' is the belief that there must be a fundamentally different way for people to relate to the planet, to each other, and to all living beings. 'Healthier' reflects the view that low environmental impact alone is not enough — if something harms human health, it cannot genuinely be called sustainable. 'Cleaner' is a challenge to the status quo across food, materials, and cosmetics, pushing toward simpler formulations and more biologically derived inputs. The three are deeply interconnected and sit at the centre of every investment decision." },

      { type: "h2", text: "The arc of impact investing — and today's inflection point" },
      { type: "p", text: "Sagar recalls entering the field in the early 2000s through microfinance and education, when philanthropic capital flowed from developed to emerging economies. Over time, philanthropists evolved into impact investors as market mechanisms came to be seen as a more durable way to address social challenges. Today, mainstream institutional investors increasingly treat impact investing as a legitimate asset class." },
      { type: "p", text: "Yet structural gaps remain. UN and UNCTAD estimates put the SDG financing gap in developing countries at roughly USD 2.5–4 trillion per year; GIIN estimates the global impact investing market at around USD 1.6 trillion in 2023. Murakami frames the gap as the defining opportunity for impact investors, because that is precisely where fundamental, systemic change becomes possible." },
      { type: "p", text: "Sagar returns to Eiichi Shibusawa's concept of the 'harmony of morality and economy' as the heart of impact investing — building companies and deploying capital in ways that create harmony between society and nature, so the next generation inherits a future in which both can flourish." },

      { type: "h2", text: "Impact or return? — Beyond the trade-off" },
      { type: "p", text: "Sagar explains how Beyond Impact navigates the perennial question of whether impact and financial return can coexist. The process begins with conventional investment analysis — assessing the business on its financial and commercial merits — before applying the impact lens. For impact to be real and durable, the underlying solution must be commercially viable; equally, the team will not invest in an opportunity that is commercially sound but cannot articulate a clear Theory of Change. LCA and other quantitative tools are standard for verifying expected impact on climate-related startups." },
      { type: "p", text: "Investment agreements also embed protective covenants: if a portfolio company that initially provided a positive solution comes to cause harm to the climate, nature, or animals, Beyond Impact retains the right to divest. With LPs, the message is direct — being an impact fund does not mean accepting below-market returns. The aim is market-rate returns, equivalent to what investors would expect from a mainstream VC." },

      { type: "h2", text: "Why UMITO Partners entered blue finance" },
      { type: "p", text: "Murakami describes UMITO Partners' founding belief that fishers are the key actors in solving ocean challenges. But as the team continued its sustainable fisheries consulting, the pace at which fisheries can transition toward sustainability simply could not keep pace with environmental deterioration. Policy work carries significant systemic leverage, yet it is slow, volatile, and largely outside the private sector's direct control." },
      { type: "p", text: "The team asked what the private sector could do to generate direct, scalable impact. The answer: support innovations capable of regenerating the ocean environment — backed by stable, patient capital. Consulting, by contrast, has a structural ceiling; the more impact you try to generate, the more human time it demands. Ocean challenges are complex and interconnected, requiring not a single solution but a portfolio of complementary solutions deployed in parallel." },
      { type: "p", text: "Murakami notes that the decision to enter blue finance was made not in a meeting room but during a team retreat in nature — sitting together by a riverbank after an afternoon in a mountain stream. He frames UMITO Partners not as a 'solution provider' but as an 'ecosystem player' — convinced that what resolves systemic ocean challenges is Collective Impact: people from different disciplines working under a shared agenda to create change none could achieve alone." },

      { type: "h2", text: "How Beyond Impact and UMITO Partners came together" },
      { type: "p", text: "Beyond Impact had built deep expertise across next-generation food systems, bio-derived materials, advanced nutrition, and bio-derived cosmetic ingredients. The ocean was a clear strategic priority where its expertise was limited — and as a lean team, entering with conviction required the right partner. UMITO Partners' depth of knowledge on ocean challenges and strong on-the-ground network across Asian island communities matched exactly what they were looking for." },
      { type: "p", text: "For Murakami, the partnership was rooted in the seriousness both Sagar and Claire brought to impact investing. For Sagar, the human dimension was decisive — a handshake carrying as much weight as a legal contract. What struck him was that Murakami had come to the field from years working close to fishing communities, engaging firsthand with the social and environmental dimensions of that work." },

      { type: "h2", text: "Innovators and fishers, building trust together" },
      { type: "p", text: "Murakami emphasises that fishers play an irreplaceable role that runs deeper than food supply — essential to national and food security, cultural continuity, and community cohesion. The embodied, experiential knowledge fishers have built across generations cannot be acquired quickly, and is precisely the kind of knowledge that should be integrated into emerging technologies and solutions." },
      { type: "p", text: "Sagar adds that innovation tends to generate anxiety, but these technologies should not replace fishers — they should expand what is possible for them. The vision of innovators and fishers evolving together, building trust and working side by side, is both realistic and nature-positive. What BFF is ultimately working to restore is natural capital — but the cultural capital that fishing communities have cultivated over generations is equally a form of value that must be integrated into that vision." },

Originally published by UMITO Partners (text by Eri Ishida)." },

      { type: "p", text: "Sagar explains that the blue economy was not originally part of Beyond Impact's investment strategy. But stepping back to look at the portfolio, the team realised six companies were already operating in the blue bioeconomy — working with microalgae, cyanobacteria and marine bacteria, plant-based or cultivated seafood, and bio-based ingredients derived from seaweed and microalgae. The conclusion: blue cannot exist without green, and green cannot exist without blue. Terrestrial life, marine life, and the global climate system are deeply interconnected." },
      { type: "p", text: "Compared with forests, terrestrial biodiversity, and decarbonisation, the ocean is dramatically underrepresented in climate investment conversations. Plant-based meat alternatives had already attracted significant commercial investment; plant-based or cultivated seafood had received a fraction. The technical barrier is higher — cultivating complex marine organisms is scientifically far more challenging than cultivating bovine cells — but Sagar sees that difficulty as the opportunity. Microalgae and seaweed remain resources of extraordinary versatility and sustainability whose potential is largely untapped at commercial scale." },

      { type: "h2", text: "Solutions, not commodities — Beyond Impact's investment framework" },
      { type: "p", text: "The Beyond Group operates multiple investment vehicles. On the ETF side, Beyond Investing has grown to approximately USD 133 million in AUM. On the venture side, Beyond Impact operates as a dedicated impact VC with three active vehicles. Combined AUM across ETFs and VC funds exceeds USD 160 million." },
      { type: "p", text: "Within the kinder/cleaner/healthier framework, the largest investment domain is Advanced Nutrition — a concept broader and more precise than 'food tech.' The focus is on underlying ingredients and production processes: alternative proteins, alternative lipids, and advanced bio-derived molecules used in flavours, fragrances, and colorants. On the technology side, the team covers precision fermentation, cellular agriculture, molecular farming, and fungi- and mycelium-based platforms — actively seeking cross-sector technologies that are not locked into a single application but can be deployed across food, materials, and pharmaceuticals." },
      { type: "p", text: "The second domain is biomaterials: biodegradable or bio-based alternatives to petroleum- and animal-derived inputs, including next-generation replacements for plastics, polyurethane, and leather. The third is the intersection of Advanced Nutrition with healthcare and beauty. Across these domains, Beyond Impact has invested in close to 30 companies." },
      { type: "p", text: "Investment criteria are consistent: high value-add and strong margin potential, global scalability, and a defensible technical moat. The team does not invest in commodity-priced products — precisely where tension between impact and economic return tends to emerge. The focus is on companies that may appear limited in initial market size but carry the potential for exponential impact over time, as scale and volume drive unit costs down enough to displace conventional, high-impact alternatives. Particular emphasis is placed on multi-purpose, circular platforms: a single technology such as precision fermentation can produce proteins for food applications and raw materials for pharmaceuticals and cosmetics simultaneously." },

      { type: "h2", text: "BFF's investment thesis" },
      { type: "p", text: "BFF builds on Beyond Impact's expertise across biotech, biomaterials, and advanced nutrition — and adds the ocean as the defining axis. At the core are solutions that contribute to ocean restoration, or that leverage marine resources such as microalgae and seaweed to transform existing industries. 'Direct impact' means the technology directly contributes to the conservation of marine ecosystems. 'Indirect impact' means transforming land-based food and materials systems in ways that reduce pressure on the ocean. Holding both lenses simultaneously is what makes BFF distinctive." },
      { type: "p", text: "BFF's three core themes are blue food, biotechnology, and B2B solutions within ocean-related innovation. The focus is on deep biotech companies, ventures across the blue bioeconomy, and in some cases adjacent non-biotech domains such as materials science. The ambition is for BFF to deliver returns fully competitive with mainstream ventures — and, on that basis, to build BFF 2 and BFF 3, expanding the scale of impact with each successive vehicle." },

      { type: "h2", text: "Designing exits — delivering returns without diluting impact" },
      { type: "p", text: "In the near term, M&A exits represent the most significant opportunity, as large corporations accelerate acquisitions of innovative startups. Some companies will also emerge as category leaders and pursue independent growth through IPO. The risk both partners are always conscious of is 'impact dilution' — the erosion of a company's original mission through an ill-suited transaction. Beyond Impact is therefore extremely deliberate about identifying acquirers who will sustain and scale the impact, and about structuring exit terms with protective post-sale conditions. Murakami adds that how impact persists post-exit, and how impact covenants carry through a transaction, are areas both teams want to continue developing together." },

      { type: "h2", text: "From extraction to regeneration — the New Blue Economy" },
      { type: "p", text: "Murakami highlights the systems-level context: approximately 26% of global greenhouse gas emissions come from the food sector, with around 14% attributable to animal protein production specifically. Approximately 78% of eutrophication in the world's ocean and freshwater systems is driven by agriculture — meaning land-based protein production is directly degrading marine environments through nutrient runoff. Advancing alternative and sustainable solutions is not optional; it is necessary." },
      { type: "p", text: "Sagar emphasises biodiversity. Many species are being pushed toward extinction by continuous extraction of natural resources. If BFF can quantify its contribution to biodiversity outcomes, that would represent extraordinary value. Fish oil is a compelling example: DHA and omega-3s consumed globally as supplements are predominantly sourced from wild-caught fish, placing significant pressure on stocks. Viable alternatives could shift this entire industry from extraction to regeneration." },
      { type: "p", text: "As marine ecosystems recover and grow richer, fish stocks rebound and fishers can sustain higher yields over time. What emerges is a healthier, more balanced relationship between human society and the natural world — mapping directly onto UMITO Partners' purpose of harmonising sustainable ties with the ocean." },

      { type: "h2", text: "Three strengths of Japan, and a bridge between Europe and Asia" },
      { type: "p", text: "Sagar sees Japan at the intersection of significant opportunity and real structural challenge. First, Japan is one of the very few developed markets genuinely trying to build sustainable finance from within — in most developed economies, impact capital has historically flowed outward to emerging markets, but Japan is asking how it itself transforms. Second, Japanese conglomerates are highly active in their search for innovation, and the food manufacturing sector has an exceptionally sophisticated industrial base; connecting emerging innovations into that base creates significant upside. Third, Japan holds an extraordinary depth of accumulated ocean knowledge — much of it living in fishing and coastal communities who have spent generations understanding fish behaviour, fishing grounds, and the seasonal rhythms of the sea." },
      { type: "p", text: "Murakami notes the structural barriers that make it hard for Japanese ocean startups to scale, and frames BFF as a hub: supporting Japanese startups in expanding globally while also attracting leading international companies into Japan. Sagar describes the mechanism as reconnecting East and West — moving beyond unidirectional trade (such as Norwegian salmon exported to Japan) toward a bidirectional flow of ideas, technologies, and resources. A Swedish microalgae supplement reaching Japan; a Japanese seaweed innovation expanding into Europe. The aim is a global ecosystem where ocean innovators converge across cultures, markets, and technological frontiers." },
      { type: "p", text: "Murakami closes on the scale of impact available across the island nations and coastal countries of the Asia-Pacific — regions of acute and urgent need that BFF will prioritise accordingly. Connecting the best ocean innovation across borders, generating new opportunities and sustainable solutions: that is the mission both teams see for BFF." },

I imagine climate change played a significant role, or perhaps it was a combination of neglect, abstraction, and the slow violence of development that doesn't account for living things. Whatever the reason, its disappearance deprived the region's subsistence fisherfolk of their primary food source. They didn't just lose a river; they lost their livelihoods, their identity, their connection to something larger than themselves." },

The transformation of the pharmaceutical endotoxin testing space perfectly illustrates this zero-extraction return engine. When the U.S. Pharmacopeia officially recognized synthetic, recombinant alternatives as safe and effective in May 2025, it didn't just slow down wild horseshoe crab harvesting — it triggered an immediate, systemic race among Eli Lilly, GSK, Amgen, and Moderna to permanently adopt cell-grown, bio-identical alternatives like recombinant cascade reagent (rCR) technology." },

      { type: "p", text: "An early pioneer of alt proteins investment and longtime plant-based, Beyond Impact's Claire Smith has witnessed a great deal of change in the sector and, as she explains, she's adjusted her own approach accordingly. \"In the early days of 2017, we focused on alt-protein companies creating meat and dairy substitutes for the animal-free/vegetarian lifestyle market. The thesis then focused on the potential for these products to disrupt the conventional food industry by offering convenient, animal-free options." },
      { type: "p", text: "\"I now prioritize investments in B2B biotech companies focused on novel methods of producing proteins, fats, and other ingredients through precision fermentation, cell culturing, and other synbio platforms. I now invest further upstream, where core IP and technological capabilities are being developed." },
      { type: "p", text: "\"My current investment lens looks at companies for B2B clients (food, skincare, materials) with the appeal and potential to disrupt animal industrials action through cost-competitive, functional, and sustainable ingredients enabled by their proprietary biotech platforms.\"" },
      { type: "h2", text: "Animal-free investing" },
      { type: "p", text: "When it comes to alt proteins, specifically, Smith details a clear-cut strategy for those seeking her investment. \"We don't invest in anything that relies on animals, including insects or companies that serve the animal/fish feed industry. Not only are insects sentient creatures that deserve our respect and consideration, but insect-based protein production may also not be as sustainable,\" she says." },
      { type: "p", text: "And although there are several opportunities she isn't remotely interested in, Smith describes herself as technology agnostic. \"Ingredients and materials can be synthesized/produced from various technologies such as plant-based, biomass fermentation, molecular farming, algae fermentation, cellular agriculture, gas fermentation, precision fermentation, etc. We evaluate each on its own merits with the aim of identifying the right application that provides a healthier, cleaner, and environmentally friendlier substitute that can reduce costs (to achieve price parity) and provide the right taste, texture, and feel.\"" },
      { type: "h2", text: "Disruption in the near future" },
      { type: "p", text: "With that in mind, what areas does Smith predict as having the most potential to achieve those goals? \"The entire food industry that relies on animal-based proteins or functional ingredients will be disrupted in the near future, as reliance on animals is inefficient from an environmental, supply chain, and financial standpoint,\" she notes. \"A some of these companies crack the code with scale and technical challenges, production of non-animal-derived ingredients, including proteins, will flourish and impact the meat, dairy, seafood, and pet industries. We are already seeing strong adoption in the dairy and meat alternatives segments, which will rapidly rise as these startups crack the cost-parity challenge." },
      { type: "p", text: "\"Our analysis is not only based on consumer adoption, but we are also seeing huge interest among large ingredient, food, meat, seafood, and dairy companies.\" Smith reveals that Beyond Impact is currently closing transactions with two companies, one in South Korea and another in Switzerland. \"One focuses on extracting proteins and other high-value functional ingredients such as fibers from spent brewers' yeast with some strong commercialization commitments,\" she reveals. \"The other one has strong IP/patents that can fundamentally change the reliance on grow-th factors, FBS, and FBS-free media required for cultured meat production. Hence, it can make cultivated meat production closer to price parity with fully cultured meat products without a hybrid approach.\"" },

I am here for the long haul from an impact standpoint and value/patient investment standpoint. This will clean out a lot of bad apples (both entrepreneurs and investors) from the market, especially those driven by hype and not by fundamentals." },

      { type: "p", text: "\"Observing many 'bad apples' over the years means Smith can easily detail how her ethical and transparent approach differs. \"We are absolutely against animal-derived ingredients and products in the alternative protein landscape, and we go to extreme lengths with our companies to incorporate terms and clauses that they are not conducting animal testing, selling to the animal/fish feed industry, or selling hybrid animal-derived meat combined with alternative meat products. We are the only animal-free Article 9 SFDR fund, which shows how nascent the climate financing space is in recognizing the connection between climate change, the biodiversity crisis, and the economy's current dependence on animal-derived products and ingredients.\"" },
